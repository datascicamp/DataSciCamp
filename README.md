## Description

- Topics: `Data Mining` / `Computer Vision` / `Natural Language Processing` / `Reinforcement Learning/Robotics` / `Speech/Signal Proccessing`

  - `Data Mining` (DM): Usually Structured data or tabular/spreadsheet, with columns and rows that clearly define its attributes.
  - `Computer Vision` (CV): Including image/video processing with matrix/arrays as data structures.
  - `Natural Language Processing` (NLP): Usually natural language-based data like text/speech or word lattices.
  - `Speech/Signal Proccessing` (SP): Specifically, 1-dim non-structured data like signal/music/sound, and even symbolic logic-based data.
  - `Reinforcement Learning/Robotics` (RL): Using the concepts of agents or environments.


- `Rewards filter` tags show you the challenges/competitions offered prizes. 
- The Countdowns to **ENTRY DEADLINE** with respect to visitor's local time with time zone support.
- `Prize` for total prize.
